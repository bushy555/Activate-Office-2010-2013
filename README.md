Activate Office 2010/2013 (Windows command-line batch file)

With phone support now having been pulled from most Countries, trying to activate Office 2007/2010/2013 is a mugs game.  
With so many flavours of 'Office 2010 Professional' and 'Office 2013 Professional', (retail, OEM, ETM, OVM, SWR and other fancy unknown acronyms), a google search can bring back hundreds of valid activation keys, which initially activates Office, but then registering said activation on-line will then typically fall over and fail. (Invalid activation key). And is why Office 2003 is just so much superior. No bloat, No ribbon crap, just works, is good.

Found this little script somewhere. All credit to them!  
I just can't fault it working as you'd hope, on our two specific flavours of Office 2010 & 2013 Pro SP1 installs from an ISO. Have not tried it on Office 2007.
Inspect it to ensure its not some sort of viral infection thing, save it, rename it to .BAT, run from an Admin cmd prompt.
Dont get your hopes up!  Be advised that it might not work for your specific install!  

Worked beaut for me though. Chucking it up here so that I don't loose it.  I can't help it if Google finds it and that you have arrived here from Googles results.
